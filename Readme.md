# Nokia Snake Game
## What's up everyone!
    
### This is a full Python project-game, for an APC (Algorithm of Computer Programming) class,  using Pyxel extention.
#### So, I wrote a (.Docx) file, telling my conclusions and my comments about the code, to my professor. If you just want to play, ignore the file "Notes_for_my_teacher".

First of all, you must install this extension by the command:
```
 pip install pyxel
```
Then, execute the file "main.py" by the command bellow:
```
Python3 main.py
```

You'll need to write your name in the terminal for the leaderboard count.
```
Enter your name: <Bruno>
```

Controls are the arrow keys (↑ ← ↓ →) or you may use (W A S D) keys!

Q: Quit the game

R: Restart the game

The pices played are the "Gran Vals" by Francisco Tárrega, also knew as nokia ringtone, and the reverse charge call tone in Brazil. I transcribed both of them using the pyxeleditor.
